## 01/25/23 Github 260 assignment

<p>I had a couple problems with my settings which made it so that forcing a merge conflict was a bit tricky. I fixed it by putting in the terminal 'git config pull.rebase false'. I think I'm starting to understand how Github and Git finally work. </p>

## 01/27/23 Deliverable 
**Elevator Pitch**
<p>I am making an empanada website for a women in my home ward from Bolivia. It will allow her to display pictures of all her beautiful and delicious  empanadas and receive order forms from customers. Not only will there be a way to view multiple pictures of each empanada type, there will also be reviews from customers that allow additional credibility to just how delicious her food is. </p>
**Key Features**
<p> *Scroll over picture gallery. 
*Details below each picture with empanada name, ingredients, customer rating, and price
*Login option with pop-up login box
*Capability to fill out an order form if logged in. If order form is attempted without being logged in the user will be prompted to log in
*Capability to add a rating on the home page as log as logged in. If user is not logged in and attempts to leave a rating they will be prompted to login </p>
