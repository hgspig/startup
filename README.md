## 01/25/23 Github 260 assignment

<p>I had a couple problems with my settings which made it so that forcing a merge conflict was a bit tricky. I fixed it by putting in the terminal 'git config pull.rebase false'. I think I'm starting to understand how Github and Git finally work. </p>

## 01/27/23 Deliverable 
**Elevator Pitch**
<p>I am making an empanada website for a women in my home ward from Bolivia. It will allow her to display pictures of all her beautiful and delicious  empanadas and receive order forms from customers. Not only will there be a way to view multiple pictures of each empanada type, there will also be reviews from customers that allow additional credibility to just how delicious her food is. </p>

**Key Features:**

* Scroll over picture gallery. 
* Details below each picture with empanada name, ingredients, customer rating, and price
* Login option with pop-up login box
* Capability to fill out an order form if logged in. If order form is attempted without being logged in the user will be prompted to log in
* Capability to add a rating on the home page as log as logged in. If user is not logged in and attempts to leave a rating they will be prompted to login 

## 02/01/23 AWS EC2 
<p>Today I figured all my AWS stuff out to get my website up and running. I now have an official website tastyempanada.click. I had some problems with my AWS account and the domaine name purchase not getting approved but it all got fixed in the end </p>

## 02/03/23 HTTPS, TLS, and certificates
<p>Today I made my website secure. I had trouble remembering the shortcuts in VIM, don't forget: i to get into insert mode and esc to exit insert mode. </p>

## 02/08/23 HTML Website and Simon HTML
<p>The HTML Website aspect of things was very straightforward. The only part I had trouble with was resizing my profile image because it was really big to start with. I leaned a lot while doing the Simon HTML. I looked at the class simon code for a few minutes and than worked on mine while looking at the class simon webpage for a guideline. I got stuck a lot and at first I formated the bulleted lists way different but I think I understand now why they did it the way they did.</p>

## 02/08/23 CSS Practice assignment
<p>The animation was trickier than expected. This MDN page will help with that: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation#syntax
Also, I think I might change my startup to just be a task page instead. The user can login and then add their tasks to different categories and there will be a progress page and a way to send notifications to everyone else saying you finished a task. </p>

## 02/20/23 Simon CSS
<p>I was honestly really surprised by the use of div tags but I think I'm starting to figure out when to use them. I made a lot of mistakes along the way but tinkering with the code provided me with a lot of chances to figure out how it workes. It's exciting to have a website that looks so much cooler now with all the CSS elements </p>
